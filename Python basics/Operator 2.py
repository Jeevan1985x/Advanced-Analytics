# step 4
z = ['cat', 'dog']
q = 'dog'

# step 5
print('mouse' not in z)


#Create a variable z with the values 'cat' and 'dog' assigned to it, and a variable q with the value 'dog' (donâ€™t forget to use square brackets)

#Use an identity operator to determine that 'mouse' is not in the list assigned to z and then use the print() function to print your results
